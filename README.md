This repository contains research created for the University of Michigan Sports Analytics Society. Upon pitching our idea about invesitgating various trends in baseball players from both the offensive and defensive sides, I was presented three in-depth analytical questions proposed by the head of the Michigan Sports Analytics Society to lead a small analyst group through answering. Attached in the .ipynb file is the questions I was presented as the Baseball Research Analyst Team Lead, as well as an immersive walkthrough about how we obtained our information as well as the results produced from our works. 

The accompanying csv files are all necessary to have the notebook run as intended. 

Upon completing our research, my team and I presented our findings specifically on the benefits of defensive shifting in Major League Baseball at the 2022 Michigan Sports Analytics Symposium, an event at the University of Michigan that draws analysts from around the country to speak about the role of analytics in sports.
